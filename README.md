This is the Coding quiz game timer thingy.
Basically in short all you have to do is answer the questions the fastest in order to win.
When you get a wong answer you will automatically be losing 15 seconds to the clock and your final score
When you complete the task at hand you will have an option of putting your name in to the leaderboard
Reset the scores if a friend gets a score higher than yours!
come test it out! (:
